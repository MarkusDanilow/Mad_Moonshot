## Concept

The game starts when you find Aly, a stranded alien. 
His spaceship had a breakdown and now he needs to repair it to continue his journey through the galaxy.

As you find him, he asks you for help. So you have to collect the items on the lunar surface to help him 
repair his spaceship. 

When you have collected all items and the ship is repaired, he tells you that he is on his journey through the galaxy in order to find his home planet and his family. On his way from moon to moon he collects different items which he brings home to his family.
He wants you to come with him, since you seem to be alone as well.
By the way: The player will now get any information where you (in game) come from or who you are - that's top secret!

From now on both of you fly from moon to moon to collect different items and resources. 
Sometimes you have to defend yourselves against evil space pirates and other creatures. 
You need mre resources to unlock crafting blueprints to further improve your spaceship.

After ZZZ levels you arrive at Aly's home planet and meet his family.
