# Mad Moonshot

## Concept (German)

You play an astronaut (Aly) who is stranded in space.
The last thing he remembers is that he was on a mission to a distant moon together with his crew.
But there is no trace of them - or of his spaceship.

Luckily he has his spacesuit on with enough oxygen reserves.

Around him he sees lots of junk flying. He has the nasty fear that the spaceship has been destroyed and that his crew might not have made it. But what could have happened to them and their ship.

In the first level he must first learn to move. His spacesuit has nozzles for this, with which he can float to the left and right (arrow keys). After a short time he discovers what is left of their ship.
Fortunately, parts of the ship are still well preserved. Most importantly, the life support systems. So he can go back on board after each mission to recharge his oxygen. But this will not work forever...

He decides to repair the ship again. So he floats around the moon with his spacesuit and collects all the necessary parts from the debris that he needs for the repair.

With each outdoor mission, it becomes more difficult: he has to move farther and farther away from his ship, exposing himself to greater and greater dangers....

From the parts he finds, he constructs more and more useful power-ups to collect even more parts faster and thus brave the challenges of cold and merciless space.

At the end of the currently generated 100 levels is the completion of the ship - emotional relief for the protagonist and hopefully for the player.

## What all needs to be repaired on the ship?

- Outer hull - Level 3
- Cockpit (windows, doors) - Level 4
- Control console (navigation, rudder, radio etc.) - Level 5

(

- Workbench to be able to develop suit improvements. - Level 6
- Suit enhancement to be able to move further away from the spaceship and collect other parts floating further away from the ship - Level 7
  
)

- Thrusters - Level 8
- propulsion generator - level 9

=> in level 10 the ship is repaired and we are now flying around with our ship instead of our spacesuit. To find the others from our cerw and return to our home. Over radio we have reached unfortunately despite repaired radio nobody.

## Story

Where... Where am I?
The last thing I remember is that...
... I was with my crew on a journey to a far away moon.
We spent many months traveling across the galaxy in our spaceship.
Where is everybody? What happened...? Where is our ship?
I have to find the others and the ship!
Luckily my spacesuit is still intact. The joystick on my left hand looks fine. Let's see if the steering jets still work and I can steer left and right with the arrow keys....

---

Great! The control nozzles still work! And with the thruster I can drift forward.
So now I can start looking for our ship and the others. Hopefully I will find them soon...
But I have to be careful. There are asteroids buzzing around everywhere...
... and maybe debris from our spaceship.

---

Finally I reached the ship. But still no trace of the others...
Our ship has seen better times...
At least the life support systems still seem to work. So I can refill oxygen for my spacesuit at any time...
...and also refuel the nozzles of my suit.
Out there, I've seen a lot of debris flying around. Some of them still looked good.
I should try to collect these parts and at least use them to seal the big cracks in the outer hull.
For that I need some big plates and screws.

---

Very good, I was able to repair the outer hull of our ship.
Next, I should try to get the ship ready to fly again.
But that should be quite difficult. The cockpit took quite a beating....
I should seal the cockpit next and repair the doors and windows. I'll definitely need more screws and plates for that.
Also, I should keep my eyes open for transparent parts for the windows....

---

The further I get away from the ship, the faster asteroids become. I'll have to be careful on my next outdoor missions!
At least the cockpit is finally sealed.
To be able to fly at all again, I must repair the central control console next.
Once it's working again, I'll be able to operate the radio again and hopefully reach the others in my crew.
Before I go out again, I should fully recharge my suit. Finding the little parts for the control console out there is definitely not going to be easy.

---

The search for the spare parts for the control console took forever. But with a lot of perseverance and a bit of dexterity, I was finally able to repair the console.
Hopefully it's not already too late to reach the others....
"Hello, can anyone hear me?"
...
"Can anyone hear me?!"
...
"Hello?!!"
Crap! This is not good...
But maybe the others are just drifting outside the radio range. I can't give up hope!
I've got to get this ship operational again!
The cockpit and the control console are already working. That leaves the engines and the generator.
For the engines I need a lot of insulation material, so the ship won't explode when I start my first flight attempt...

---

It's getting wilder and more dangerous out there. Fortunately, I only have to take care of the generator now.
I don't need much for that. Just a few plates and additional screws...
...and fuel cells.
I've already seen a few glowing in the distance. So a part of our fuel supply seems to have survived the crash in one piece...

---

I have everything and the ship should be operational again now.
All that remains is to hope that the fuel cells are really still intact and the first ignition doesn't end in a big explosion....
I start the turbines in 3...
2...
1...
